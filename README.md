MongoPeopleAPI
=======================

The MongoPeopleAPI is an exploration of the MongoDB Driver for C# that uses a simple WebAPI. It was inspired and designed to model the API from Chapter 7 of Knockout.js Succinctly (http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks/knockoutjs).

I have to credit the following articles online for guiding me in the right direction with creating this API:
